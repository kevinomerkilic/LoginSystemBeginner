⚡ Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/kevinomerkilic/C++-Login-System.git
cd LoginSystemBeginner
2️⃣ Compile & Run the Code
g++ login_system.cpp -o login_system
./login_system
🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Sign Up – Enter a username, email, and password. The data is stored in loginData.txt.
2️⃣ Log In – Enter your username and password. If they match, access is granted!
3️⃣ Forgot Password – Enter your username & email to retrieve your password.

🛠 Future Improvements

🔥 Encrypt passwords instead of storing them in plain text.
🔥 Use a database like MySQL for scalable user management.
🔥 Add a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for better user experience.
